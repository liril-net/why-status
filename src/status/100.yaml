    The client *SHOULD* continue with its request. This interim response is used to inform the client that the initial part of the request has been received and has not yet been rejected by the server. The client *SHOULD* continue by sending the remainder of the request or, if the request has already been completed, ignore this response. The server *MUST* send a final response after the request has been completed.

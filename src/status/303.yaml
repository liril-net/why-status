    The response to the request can be found under a different URI and *SHOULD* be retrieved using a GET method on that resource. This method exists primarily to allow the output of a POST-activated script to redirect the user agent to a selected resource. The new URI is not a substitute reference for the originally requested resource. The 303 response *MUST NOT* be cached, but the response to the second (redirected) request might be cacheable.

    The different URI *SHOULD* be given by the Location field in the response. Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the response *SHOULD* contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s).

      Note: Many pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents do not understand the 303
      status. When interoperability with such clients is a concern, the
      302 status code may be used instead, since most user agents react
      to a 302 response as described here for 303.

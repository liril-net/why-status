  brief: Not Modified
  description: |
    If the client has performed a conditional GET request and access is allowed, but the document has not been modified, the server *SHOULD* respond with this status code. The 304 response *MUST NOT* contain a message-body, and thus is always terminated by the first empty line after the header fields.

    The response *MUST* include the following header fields:

      - Date, unless its omission is required

    If a clockless origin server obeys these rules, and proxies and clients add their own Date to any response received without one, caches will operate correctly.

      - ETag and/or Content-Location, if the header would have been sent
        in a 200 response to the same request
      - Expires, Cache-Control, and/or Vary, if the field-value might
        differ from that sent in any previous response for the same
        variant

    If the conditional GET used a strong cache validator, the response *SHOULD NOT* include other entity-headers. Otherwise (i.e., the conditional GET used a weak validator), the response *MUST NOT* include other entity-headers; this prevents inconsistencies between cached entity-bodies and updated headers.

    If a 304 response indicates an entity not currently cached, then the cache *MUST* disregard the response and repeat the request without the conditional.

    If a cache uses a received 304 response to update a cache entry, the cache *MUST* update the entry to reflect any new field values given in the response.

  brief: Reset Content
  description: |
    The server has fulfilled the partial `GET` request for the resource. The request *MUST* have included a Range header field indicating the desired range, and *MAY* have included an If-Range header field to make the request conditional.

    The response *MUST* include the following header fields:

      - Either a Content-Range header field indicating
        the range included with this response, or a multipart/byteranges
        Content-Type including Content-Range fields for each part. If a
        Content-Length header field is present in the response, its
        value *MUST* match the actual number of OCTETs transmitted in the
        message-body.
      - Date
      - ETag and/or Content-Location, if the header would have been sent
        in a 200 response to the same request
      - Expires, Cache-Control, and/or Vary, if the field-value might
        differ from that sent in any previous response for the same
        variant

    If the 206 response is the result of an If-Range request that used a strong cache validator, the response *SHOULD* NOT include other entity-headers. If the response is the result of an If-Range request that used a weak validator, the response *MUST NOT* include other entity-headers; this prevents inconsistencies between cached entity-bodies and updated headers. Otherwise, the response *MUST* include all of the entity-headers that would have been returned with a 200 (OK) response to the same request.

    A cache *MUST NOT* combine a 206 response with other previously cached content if the ETag or Last-Modified headers do not match exactly.

    A cache that does not support the Range and Content-Range headers *MUST NOT* cache 206 (Partial) responses.

  brief: Use Proxy
  description: |
    The requested resource *MUST* be accessed through the proxy given by the Location field. The Location field gives the URI of the proxy. The recipient is expected to repeat this single request via the proxy. 305 responses *MUST* only be generated by origin servers.

    Note: RFC 2068 was not clear that 305 was intended to redirect a
    single request, and to be generated by origin servers only.  Not
    observing these limitations has significant security consequences.

  brief: Accepted
  description: |
    The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. The request might or might not eventually be acted upon, as it might be disallowed when processing actually takes place. There is no facility for re-sending a status code from an asynchronous operation such as this.

    The 202 response is intentionally non-committal. Its purpose is to allow a server to accept a request for some other process (perhaps a batch-oriented process that is only run once per day) without requiring that the user agent's connection to the server persist until the process is completed. The entity returned with this response *SHOULD* include an indication of the request's current status and either a pointer to a status monitor or some estimate of when the user can expect the request to be fulfilled.

  brief: 已接受
  description: |
    请求已经被接受并处理，但处理过程并未结束。该请求可能在处理过程中被拒绝，因此最终不一定会被执行。当前尚且不能从这样的异步操作中重发状态码。

    202 响应是故意设计成不明确的。它的目的是为了允许服务器接受针对其他处理过程（可能是一天才运行一次批处理）的请求，而不用使得客户端在处理结束前一直与服务端保持连接。这一响应返回的实体 *应该* 包含请求当前的状态信息或者指向状态监控的指针，还可以是对处理结束的预估时间。

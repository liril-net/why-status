  brief: Found
  description: |
    The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI. Since the redirection might be altered on occasion, the client *SHOULD* continue to use the Request-URI for future requests. This response is only cacheable if indicated by a Cache-Control or Expires header field.

    The temporary URI *SHOULD* be given by the Location field in the response. Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the response *SHOULD* contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s).

    If the 302 status code is received in response to a request other than GET or HEAD, the user agent *MUST NOT* automatically redirect the request unless it can be confirmed by the user, since this might change the conditions under which the request was issued.

      Note: RFC 1945 and RFC 2068 specify that the client is not allowed
      to change the method on the redirected request.  However, most
      existing user agent implementations treat 302 as if it were a 303
      response, performing a GET on the Location field-value regardless
      of the original request method. The status codes 303 and 307 have
      been added for servers that wish to make unambiguously clear which
      kind of reaction is expected of the client.

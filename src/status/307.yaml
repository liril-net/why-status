  brief: Temporary Redirect
  description: |
    The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI. Since the redirection *MAY* be altered on occasion, the client *SHOULD* continue to use the Request-URI for future requests. This response is only cacheable if indicated by a Cache-Control or Expires header field.

    The temporary URI *SHOULD* be given by the Location field in the response. Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the response *SHOULD* contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s) , since many pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents do not understand the 307 status. Therefore, the note *SHOULD* contain the information necessary for a user to repeat the original request on the new URI.

    If the 307 status code is received in response to a request other than GET or HEAD, the user agent *MUST NOT* automatically redirect the request unless it can be confirmed by the user, since this might change the conditions under which the request was issued.

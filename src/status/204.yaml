    The server has fulfilled the request but does not need to return an entity-body, and might want to return updated metainformation. The response *MAY* include new or updated metainformation in the form of entity-headers, which if present *SHOULD* be associated with the requested variant.

    If the client is a user agent, it *SHOULD* NOT change its document view from that which caused the request to be sent. This response is primarily intended to allow input for actions to take place without causing a change to the user agent's active document view, although any new or updated metainformation *SHOULD* be applied to the document currently in the user agent's active view.

    The 204 response *MUST NOT* include a message-body, and thus is always terminated by the first empty line after the header fields.
